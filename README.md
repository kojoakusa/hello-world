# hello-world
My first repository

Hi there! Wasup?

I'm Kojo. I'm pretty much a novice at programming. You can call me Noob Saibot. I started learning C# and Javascript recently, after a short stint with Visual Basic and C++ millions of years ago. 
My goal is to leave the jurasic age and change from my current fossilized state into a programming ninja.
